# Virgo Keyboard PCB

This folder contains the KiCad electrical design of the Virgo keyboard. This
keyboard is controlled by an RP2040 running QMK. It uses the Kailh X-switch,
and is both n-key rollover and per-key RGB backlit. A pointing stick module can
be added, with minor switch and keycap modifications.
